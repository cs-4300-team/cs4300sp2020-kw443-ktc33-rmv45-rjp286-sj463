            Our goal is to provide a personalized party playlist to a group of people based on
            their personal playlists. This app would allow users to link their Spotify playlists to produce one
            playlist for everyone based on their music preferences. The target audience would be people who listen
            to music and want an easy way to create a playlist that fits everyone's taste of music. This would be
            unique because we don't think there is a service which returns a playlist for everyone based on their
            own music preferences. The data would be the set of playlists retrieved from Spotify and sets of
            comments from Reddit pages about different songs. It will search for songs in common with other users
            from our scraped playlists as well as new songs recommended for everyone after analyzing similarities
            between Reddit user
            comments on the song pages. It will also look at other metrics such as genre, artists, and audio
            features (e.g. tempo, loudness, energy, etc) in developing a shared playlist. The creation of our app
            will allow
            for multiple people to enjoy their music at the same time with one playlist that fits everyoneâ€™s music
            taste.
